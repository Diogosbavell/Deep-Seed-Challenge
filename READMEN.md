Objective:
---------
Project developed based on the challenge presented in the document **Tests of logic and specific skills**.

Premises:
------------
1. Csv files were used as input. So expect proper formatting to .csv format without empty lines with comma separation;
2. The number of rows in the tables referring to wells and spools were considered equal,
that is, the balancing of the tables was not considered. It is expected that regardless of the origin, the
tables have correlations, as in the case of the database for example; and
3. The spool name and well name were considered as parity indexes, which is done through
of the growing organization of items. Such a measure can also be used for data from
databases, such as mysql or postgres, for example.

Compilation:
-----------
version: g++.exe (MinGW.org GCC Build-2) 9.2.0 <br/>
To compile: g++ *.cpp

Comments:
------------
1. As a means of visualization, the code generates results in the outputData folder. Pipe diameter values ​​are presented in the Mflow1.txt and Mgeometry1.txt files, which are directly linked to each calculation model with the same name. Furthermore, a combination of html, css and javascript was used to present the data in a responsive HTML page, which is opened right after the code performs the calculations. The aim is to improve the experience with the developer; and
2. The input files are inserted in the inputData folder with the respective names: spool.csv and well.csv.
